# Open Issues

- Some builds (daredevil, spectre) show false skills (like aa from mesmer GS)
- The skill cast detection logic needs to be improved
- Addon Icon at the top bar is incorrect / not loading
- Skill detection logics needs to include cast times
- Some builds have duo logs uplaoded (like Condition Daredevil Dagger) - there my webparser script downloaded the wrong log

## TODO

- Add Skill Activation Time to Logs
- Add Skill Activation Time Logic
- Make the actual AA irrelevant for the aa chain
