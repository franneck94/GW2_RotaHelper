# Open Issues

- Number of Auto Attacks instead of list of auto attacks
- Some builds (daredevil, spectre) show false skills (like aa from mesmer GS)
- The skill cast detection logic needs to be improved
- Addon ICON not loading

Idea:

Currently: If Skill cast detected we go to next.
Better: Only go to next skill if a new one is casted.
If its the same skill thats also fine.
