# Open Issues

- Number of Auto Attacks instead of list of auto attacks
- **Mesmer Greatsword**: Auto-attack detection requires refinement for optimal accuracy
- After ~2hrs the game feerzes with memory issues
- Some builds (daredevil, spectre) show false skills (like aa from mesmer GS)
- The skill cast detection logic needs to be improved

- Red Rect if skill was not correct
- Hover skill info in horizontal mode
- Willbender F1 is shown twice (its on prupose by arcdps)
